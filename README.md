Hello I'm Elvis Jackson
To summarize this project it is a banking up that calculates the growth of an account as well as including the monthly deposits.
I felt I did the layout well and setting up the calculations to find the growth of the account.
I feel that clearing the screen at different points, anjd adding calculations for withdraw would have been a great addition... Most importantly a login.
I think writing algorthims will be the most transferable to otehr projects. Having a better understanding of the syntax of the language and how it can be used, will be helpful...
My use of statements will make the code more readable. The lack of magic numbers will make it more maintainable and manageable. The functions useage will make for an easy adaptaion.
